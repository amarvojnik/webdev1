            <h3>Transformers 1</h3>
            <p>Transformers is a great movie, and it would not have been able to become such a successful franchise without the first instalment of the films! With great large robotoic fights and amazing looking vehcials and special effects, this one lays at number two on my list on the three of the films!</p>

            <h3>Transformers 2</h3>
            <p>Transformers 2, while it has a lot of debate around the film, the fighting sequences, the driving, and even better effects makes it a great movie to me. Although not as good as the first or first due to the storyline, I will have to put it at number three, Although i still give it much praise. </p>

            <h3>Transformers 3</h3>
            <p>This, this is possibly the best movie of all time. The cars, acting, and story are all INSANE!! This is a movie for the books, and will forever be my favorite. I honestly don't think i've ever cried so much during a movie, because they lied about leaving and I was literally bawling my eyes out in front of my family</p>
